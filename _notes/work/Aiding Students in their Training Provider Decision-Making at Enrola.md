title: Aiding Students in their Training Provider Decision-Making at Enrola

## Role

As Lead Product Designer at Enrola, I led the redesign of their education comparison service, working with a small, distributed team to improve how users understand and engage with course information.

## The Problem

Our data and course advisor engagement revealed a critical issue: people were signing up to courses without fully understanding what they were committing to. This implied that the digital experience was either confusing or 

## Leading Design with a Small, Distributed Team

### Understanding Through Documentation

I initiated the process by creating an RFC (Request for Comments) document to:

- Clearly articulate the problem space
    
- Gather structured feedback from stakeholders
    
- Create alignment on priorities and constraints
    

### Collaborative Design Process

To maintain momentum with our distributed team, I implemented:

- Regular wireframe reviews for early direction alignment
    
- Design reviews for solution refinement
    
- Loom recordings to share progress and gather asynchronous feedback
    

## The Solution

### Content Focus and Utility

- Prioritized information most crucial for decision-making
    
- Restructured content to highlight key course elements
    
- Ensured information directly addressed user needs
    

### Improved Scannability and Hierarchy

- Enhanced content structure for better comprehension
    
- Created clear visual hierarchy of information
    
- Implemented consistent formatting patterns
    

### Primacy Effect Implementation

- Positioned critical information at key decision points
    
- Structured information flow to support decision-making
    
- Ensured most important details received proper emphasis
    

### Trust Building Elements

- Added relevant trust indicators
    
- Integrated validation elements
    
- Enhanced credibility through strategic content placement
    

## Reflections

### The Value of Exploration

I learned that thorough exploration in the ideation phase leads to better quality solutions. While this might seem obvious, the impact of dedicated ideation time proved invaluable for developing effective solutions.

### Embracing Iterative Progress

A significant area of personal growth was learning to proceed with "good enough":

- Implemented two-week shipping cycles
    
- Used A/B testing to validate improvements
    
- Maintained rapid feedback loops through async communication
    
- Found balance between perfection and progress
    

This represented substantial growth in letting go of perfectionism in favor of continuous learning and improvement.

### Leadership Development

I faced challenges in shifting my mindset towards ownership and proactivity:

- Moving from intuitive to structured thinking
    
- Developing systematic approaches to problem-solving
    
- Asking better questions
    

### Unexpected Insights

Our work revealed that optimizing for usability didn't automatically translate to increased conversions. This highlighted the importance of:

- Measuring multiple success metrics
    
- Understanding the complexity of user decision-making
    
- Balancing different types of improvements
    

## Looking Forward

My experience at Enrola provided valuable insights into design leadership in a distributed environment. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn about:

- Leading design initiatives in remote teams
    
- Balancing speed with quality
    
- Making data-informed decisions
    
- Building effective async communication practices
    

Thank you for reading this case study. You can see what I'm up to now or proceed to the next case study.

THE PROBLEM

- People were signing up to courses without knowing what they were signing into
    

  

LEADING DESIGN WITH A SMALL, DISTRIBUTED TEAM

- Understanding the problem by requesting comments on an RFC document
    
- Aligning on the solution through Wireframe Reviews and Design Reviews 
    
- Sharing progress and inviting feedback through Loom recordings
    

  

THE SOLUTION

- Focus on content and how it’s useful for people
    
- Improving scannability and hierarchy of content
    
- Highlighting the primacy effect
    
- Adding tokens of trust
    

  
  

REFLECTIONS

- Exploration in the ideation phase leads to better quality solutions.
    

- So obvious as a designer! How did I miss the mark here?
    

  

- Proceeding with what’s good enough is a part of learning.
    

- I was really proud of my personal growth in this area, where I timeboxed my work. At the prototyping and execution level, feedback loops were snappy and I involved the team through async Loom recordings. As a solo designer, I solved interface design problems that were often shipped within 2 weeks, and significantly largely tested better when A/B tested against the previous iteration.
    
- This was a huge stride in growth for me as a designer, letting go of perfectionism and fear of failure in favour of what is essentially, continuous learning and growth.
    
- Saying so, I’ll continue to pay extra attention to design elements that build trust, add value and reduce frustration with customers.
    

  
  

- Shifting my mindset towards ownership and proactivity with the team was a challenge.
    

- I often default to intuition and scattered thought. It’s a muscle I’m developing and aspire to flex in the future, representing both the voice of customers and the business.
    

  

- Optimising for usability didn’t seem to mean more conversions…
    

- All the redesigns I helped ship tested well when compared with the previous iteration, apart from 
    

  

I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with the team at Enrola because it revealed to me the reality of design leadership. 

  

Thank you for reading.

"title:": Transitions and Growth
---
Life disruptors, big and small, occur more often now than ever before. These include relationship break ups, career changes or life-changing health diagnoses. 

We live half of our lives in transitions.

Long goodbye —> Messy middles —> New beginnings

- Mark growth and ritualise it
- Shed it and discard old narratives
- Seek wisdom from others
- Launch your new self

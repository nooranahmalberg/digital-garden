title: Consistency is key
---
Quotes from my personal trainer [Ashley Clarke](https://ashley-clarke.com.au/):

> You are not going to win on day 1. This is the game of skill development.

>The ability to build a bad habit it's easy. Why? Because they give you instant rewards. So you need to learn how to be patient to get your results. And how do you do that? You chain your habits and you stay consistent. You keep showing up.

>Change happens when you do the different thing, not when you repeat your behaviour and expect a different result.

>Moderate consistency is key to avoiding burn out. Don't miss out on it twice. Make the next decision a better one. Just don't miss twice because the third time in a row, it's going to become a habit.

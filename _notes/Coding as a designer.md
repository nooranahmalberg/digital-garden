title: Coding as a designer
---
Early in my career, I've been in rooms with software engineers discussing the feasability of an idea as a quiet observer. It felt really alienating because my understanding of how the web and applications worked was relatively shallow.

When a developer is looking at a design, the number one thing they care about is **feasability**.

These are the questions I imagine developers are

**Back end consideration:**
- Does this idea fit with the current data infrastructure/set up? Do any major underlying changes need to be made? What other areas will those changes affect?
	- As a designer, it's good to know that these changes will usually need a triage

**Front end design system consideration:**
- Can I use existing components? Do the designs follow the usage/set up of those components?
- Are there new components here? What's the reason to having a one-off implementation of XYZ? 

As a designer, thinking ahead about these questions can be helpful in discussions or when decisions are being made.

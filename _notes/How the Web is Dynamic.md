**AJAX** is short for "asynchronous javascript and XML". It's a way to send a request to the server without reloading a page. This is useful for forms, payment displays and 
Relies on heavy use of DOM (how the browser store and manipulates pages) scripting to:
- Update pages without reloading it
- Show popup windows
- Change content of page elements
- Hide, delete or move page elements
Today, a lot of this can be achieved with CSS but at the time, CSS was quite limited.

` What is remote scripting?! `

Dynamic HTML is a major component of AJAX. It's a technique of developing interfaces that relies on extended HTML, CSS, Javascript and DOM. No one really uses this term in the real world, perhaps in an academic setting. It's just the way things are done now.

AJAX = DHTML + XMLHttpRequest

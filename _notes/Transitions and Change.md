title: Transitions and Growth
---
Life disruptors, big and small, occur more often now than ever before. These include relationship break ups, career changes or life-changing health diagnoses. 

We live **half** of our lives in transitions.

Transitions typically look like this: Long goodbye —> Messy middles —> New beginnings

Bruce Feiler identified these phases of transitions to master the art of change:
- Accept the past and identify emotions
- Mark growth and ritualise it
- Shed it and discard old narratives
- Create and try new things
- Seek wisdom from others
- Launch your new self
